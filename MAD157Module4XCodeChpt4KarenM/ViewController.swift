import UIKit
//.. Sections between the "/**" and "*/" generate quickhelp in inspector area when the following function or whatever is "clicked" ... see below kamBogusFunction function for examples

//.. per LinkedIn Video, UITextFieldDelegate and following code allows for a different way to dismiss the keyboard (when the RETURN key on phone keyboard is pressed)... see textFieldShouldReturn function below
//.. Also note, you can customize the RETURN key on the phone keyboard by setting the property for the textfield (textDisplay) by showing the inspector area on the storyboard -- look under "text input traits", find the "return key" drop down, and select something (note: this doesn't define functionality...it just defines the "style" of the button). They selected "Done" in the class; So I did the same and now instead of the phone keyboard button saying "RETURN", it now says "Done"

    // MARK: Properties

        super.viewDidLoad()
        // Do any additional setup after loading the view.
        
        //.. have the focus and keyboard up on the text field... per the LinkedInVideo iOS 12 Developement Essentials Training... need to move button up on screen though so this works right... see branch firstResponder1... on here because of where button is located (lower right corner), you have to use command-K to show hide keyboard
        //.. In addition, using the storyboard and attributes inspector, for the textfield (textDisplay), set "clear button" to "is always visible" and specify "clear when editting begins" to have little "x" to clear the text in the box present and to have "hint" disappear when editting begins
        textDisplay.becomeFirstResponder()
        
        //..$$$$
        //..associate the text field with it's delegate object... see %%% below
